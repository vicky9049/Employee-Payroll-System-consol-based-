# Employee-Payroll-System-consol-based-

Project Overview

The Employee Payroll System is a Java-based application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism to manage and calculate employee salaries efficiently. It is designed to handle different types of employees such as salaried, hourly, and contract employees.

Features

Polymorphic Salary Calculation: Salaries are calculated dynamically based on the employee type.
OOP Principles: Encapsulation ensures data security, inheritance allows reusable code, abstraction defines a base structure, and polymorphism provides flexibility.
Abstract Classes: The base Employee class defines a common structure for all employee types, ensuring modularity.
Scalable Design: Easily extendable to add new employee types or salary rules in the future.

Employee Types
Salaried Employee: Receives a fixed monthly salary.
Hourly Employee: Salary calculated based on hourly rate and hours worked.
Contract Employee: Receives a fixed contract amount.
